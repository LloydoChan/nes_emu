# nes_emu
6502 emulation and other parts of the Famicom / Nintendo Entertainment system

Only has adc instructions of the 6502 for now, of course all copyright of the hardware itself belongs to nintendo and I do not endorse using copyrighted ROMs. There are plenty of public domain ROMs and homebrew that you can use on the emulator.

TODO:
finish the 6502
create a ppu emu
create a apu emu
add controls
